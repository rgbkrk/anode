- âœ… **Python execution** - Pyodide runtime with optimized startup
- âœ… **AI integration** - Full context awareness including cell outputs
- âœ… **Runtime stability** - Bug #34 resolved, reliable across restarts
- âœ… **Rich outputs** - ANSI handling, matplotlib, pandas display
- âœ… **UI/UX** - Clean interface with visibility controls

**AI Features:**

- âœ… **Dual-mode ANSI** - Clean text for AI, colored display for users
- âœ… **Output integration** - AI receives text/plain, text/markdown from executions
- âœ… **Mock fallback** - Works without OpenAI API key for development

**Performance:**
- âœ… **Startup optimization** - Parallelized Pyodide loading
- âœ… **Package caching** - Pre-loaded common packages for faster execution
- âœ… **Execution timing** - Performance tracking and monitoring
- âœ… **Connection reliability** - Improved runtime heartbeat and status

### What Needs Enhancement ðŸš§

**AI Tool Calling** - Next major feature:
- ðŸš§ AI cannot create, modify, or delete cells
- ðŸš§ AI cannot execute code directly
- ðŸš§ No function calling infrastructure for notebook manipulation

**Integration Testing** - Verification needed:
- ðŸš§ Performance benchmarks for startup times
- ðŸš§ Multi-user collaboration stress testing

**Runtime Management** - Convenience improvements:
- ðŸš§ Manual runtime startup still creates friction
- ðŸš§ No automatic runtime provisioning
- ðŸš§ Kernel lifecycle management could be smoother

## Next Development Priorities

**AI Tool Calling** - Enable AI to create, modify, and execute cells using OpenAI function calling

## Development Commands

Current workflow (user typically runs these in separate terminals):

```bash
# Core services
pnpm dev              # Web client + sync backend

# Runtime (get command from notebook UI)
NOTEBOOK_ID=notebook-id-from-ui pnpm dev:runtime

# Individual services
pnpm dev:web-only     # Web client only
pnpm dev:sync-only    # Sync backend only

# Testing & validation
pnpm test             # Run test suite
pnpm lint             # Code linting
pnpm type-check       # TypeScript validation
pnpm build            # Build all packages

# Cache management
pnpm cache:warm-up    # Pre-load common packages
pnpm cache:stats      # Show cache statistics
```

## Current Status Summary

**Excellent Foundation**: The collaborative notebook system is working well with real-time editing, Python execution, and AI integration.

**Major Progress**: Recent weeks have seen substantial improvements in AI context awareness, runtime stability, and user experience.

**Ready for Next Phase**: The system is ready for AI tool calling implementation - the biggest remaining feature gap.

**Strong Documentation**: Comprehensive docs covering architecture, proposals, and implementation details.

**Testing Gaps**: Main weakness is lack of integration testing to verify claimed functionality.

## CI/Deployment Status âœ…

### Current State - Production Working!
- âœ… **Production Deployment Live** - https://anode.pages.dev working with Python execution
- âœ… **Manual Deployment Working** - Both Pages and Workers deploy successfully  
- âœ… **Split Architecture** - Pages for web client, Workers for sync backend
- âœ… **Authentication Working** - Google OAuth + fallback token configured
- âœ… **WebSocket Connectivity** - Real-time collaboration functional

### Production Architecture - Working âœ…

**Production Setup (Live):**
- **Worker (Sync Backend)**: `https://anode-docworker.rgbkrk.workers.dev`
  - Deploy: `cd packages/docworker && npm run deploy`
  - Healthy metrics: 127 requests, 34 errors, 4.1ms avg CPU time
  - Enhanced with `/health` and `/debug/auth` endpoints
  - Production validation: Fails to start if missing `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- **Pages (Web Client)**: `https://anode.pages.dev`  
  - Deploy: `cd packages/web-client && pnpm wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name anode`
  - Successfully serving from main branch commit b517d99

**Authentication Production-Ready:**
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` configured
- `AUTH_TOKEN` set for runtime agent authentication
- Google OAuth validation with fallback token support
- Fixed WebSocket header immutability issues

### Worker Configuration Clarity ðŸš§

**Current Situation:**
- **`anode-docworker`** - Production worker serving https://anode.pages.dev (this is what we want)
- **`anode`** - CI worker (legacy, probably from CI experimentation)

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. **Option A**: Rename CI worker to `anode-ci` and keep `anode-docworker` for production
2. **Option B**: Drop GitHub CI deployments, stick with manual deploys for now
3. **Option C**: Standardize on `anode-docworker` building from `main` branch

**Current Working Approach:** Manual deployments to production, CI workers separate

### Debugging Enhancements âœ…

**New Debug Capabilities (on `fix/worker-health-debug` branch):**
- **Production safety**: Worker fails to start if misconfigured  
- **Health endpoint**: `GET /health` shows deployment status and config
- **Auth debugging**: `POST /debug/auth` tests authentication tokens
- **Better error messages**: Specific codes like `GOOGLE_TOKEN_INVALID`, `MISSING_AUTH_TOKEN`
- **Fixed WebSocket errors**: No more immutable headers failures

**Ready to merge**: `fix/worker-health-debug` branch contains production-tested improvements

## Next Developer Success Path

1. **Implement AI tool calling** - Biggest user-facing improvement (function calling architecture exists)
2. **Clarify CI/deployment strategy** - Decide between manual vs automated deployments  
3. **Add integration tests** - Verify system actually works as claimed
4. **Automate runtime management** - Remove remaining friction

**Current Status**: Production system is working well! Python execution, real-time collaboration, and authentication all functional. Ready for next major feature development phase.

### What's Actually Working âœ…

**Core System:**
- âœ… **LiveStore integration** - Real-time collaboration working reliably
- âœ… **Python execution** - Pyodide runtime with optimized startup
- âœ… **AI integration** - Full context awareness including cell outputs
- âœ… **Runtime stability** - Bug #34 resolved, reliable across restarts
- âœ… **Rich outputs** - ANSI handling, matplotlib, pandas display
- âœ… **UI/UX** - Clean interface with visibility controls

**AI Features:**
- âœ… **Context awareness** - AI sees both source code and execution outputs
- âœ… **Visibility controls** - Users can toggle what AI sees per cell
- âœ… **Dual-mode ANSI** - Clean text for AI, colored display for users
- âœ… **Output integration** - AI receives text/plain, text/markdown from executions
- âœ… **Mock fallback** - Works without OpenAI API key for development

**Performance:**
- âœ… **Startup optimization** - Parallelized Pyodide loading
- âœ… **Package caching** - Pre-loaded common packages for faster execution
- âœ… **Execution timing** - Performance tracking and monitoring
- âœ… **Connection reliability** - Improved runtime heartbeat and status

### What Needs Enhancement ðŸš§

**AI Tool Calling** - Next major feature:
- ðŸš§ AI cannot create, modify, or delete cells
- ðŸš§ AI cannot execute code directly
- ðŸš§ No function calling infrastructure for notebook manipulation

**Integration Testing** - Verification needed:
- ðŸš§ Performance benchmarks for startup times
- ðŸš§ Multi-user collaboration stress testing

**Runtime Management** - Convenience improvements:
- ðŸš§ Manual runtime startup still creates friction
- ðŸš§ No automatic runtime provisioning
- ðŸš§ Kernel lifecycle management could be smoother

## Next Development Priorities

Basic Deployment on CloudFlare

## Development Commands

Current workflow (user typically runs these in separate terminals):

```bash
# Core services
pnpm dev              # Web client + sync backend

# Runtime (get command from notebook UI)
NOTEBOOK_ID=notebook-id-from-ui pnpm dev:runtime

# Individual services
pnpm dev:web-only     # Web client only
pnpm dev:sync-only    # Sync backend only

# Testing & validation
pnpm test             # Run test suite
pnpm lint             # Code linting
pnpm type-check       # TypeScript validation
pnpm build            # Build all packages

# Cache management
pnpm cache:warm-up    # Pre-load common packages
pnpm cache:stats      # Show cache statistics
```

## Current Status Summary

**Excellent Foundation**: The collaborative notebook system is working well with real-time editing, Python execution, and AI integration.

**Major Progress**: Recent weeks have seen substantial improvements in AI context awareness, runtime stability, and user experience.

**Ready for Next Phase**: The system is ready for AI tool calling implementation - the biggest remaining feature gap.

**Strong Documentation**: Comprehensive docs covering architecture, proposals, and implementation details.

**Testing Gaps**: Main weakness is lack of integration testing to verify claimed functionality.

## CI/Deployment Status ðŸš§

### Current State
- âœ… **PR Comments Working** - CI build logs now appear in PR comments
- ðŸš§ **Build Failing** - Worker name mismatch and database ID issues
- âœ… **Manual Deployment Working** - `pnpm wrangler deploy --env production` works
- âœ… **Split Architecture** - Pages for web client, Workers for sync backend

### Issues to Resolve

**CI Configuration Problems:**
- CI expects worker name "anode" but config has "anode-docworker"
- Development environment uses `database_id = "local"` which CI can't use
- Build command mismatch between CI settings and actual commands

**Current CI Settings:**
```
Build command: npm run build
Deploy command: pnpm run deploy
Version command: npx wrangler versions upload
Root directory: /packages/docworker
Production branch: main
Non-production builds: Enabled
```

**Error Details:**
```
Failed to match Worker name. Your config file is using "anode-docworker", but CI expected "anode"
binding DB of type d1 must have a valid `id` specified [code: 10021]
```

### Deployment Architecture

**Working Manual Setup:**
- **Worker (Sync Backend)**: `https://anode-docworker.rgbkrk.workers.dev`
  - Deploy: `cd packages/docworker && pnpm wrangler deploy --env production`
  - Config: `packages/docworker/wrangler.toml` with Google OAuth setup
- **Pages (Web Client)**: `https://anode.pages.dev`
  - Deploy: `cd packages/web-client && pnpm wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name anode`
  - Config: `packages/web-client/wrangler.toml` with environment variables

**Authentication Fixed:**
- Worker now has `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` for proper OAuth validation
- CORS headers configured for cross-origin WebSocket connections
- Environment-specific configs for production vs development

### Next Steps for CI
1. **Add CI environment** to `packages/docworker/wrangler.toml`:
   ```toml
   [env.ci]
   name = "anode"  # Match CI expectations
   database_id = "5339094f-f406-4236-97c3-ada460373f18"  # Real DB ID
   ```
2. **Configure CI** to use `--env ci` for non-production builds
3. **Consider preview-only builds** for open source security (UI only, no sync backend)

**Note**: Avoid breaking local development setup when fixing CI issues.

## Next Developer Success Path

1. **Fix CI deployment** - Add proper CI environment configuration
2. **Implement AI tool calling** - Biggest user-facing improvement
3. **Add integration tests** - Verify system actually works as claimed
4. **Automate runtime management** - Remove remaining friction

The system has a solid foundation and is ready for the next major feature development phase.

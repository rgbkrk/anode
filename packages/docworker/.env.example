# Anode Docworker Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env for local development

# Authentication token for sync backend
# This should match the token used by clients
# For local development, keep as default
# For production, use a secure random token: openssl rand -base64 32
AUTH_TOKEN=insecure-token-change-me

# =============================================================================
# DEVELOPMENT NOTES
# =============================================================================

# Local Development:
# - Copy this file: cp .env.example .env
# - Keep AUTH_TOKEN as default for local testing
# - Start docworker: pnpm dev (from packages/docworker)

# Prototype Environment Deployment:
# - Set AUTH_TOKEN as Cloudflare Worker secret:
#   pnpm wrangler secret put AUTH_TOKEN --env prototype
# - Deploy: pnpm wrangler deploy --env prototype
# - The .env file is not used in prototype deployment (secrets are used instead)
# - Prototype environment is for testing collaboration, demos, and team development

# Security:
# - Never commit .env files to git
# - Use unique tokens for each environment
# - Rotate tokens regularly

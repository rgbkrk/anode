# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration Proposal

**Status**: Draft Proposal  
**Author**: Development Team  
**Date**: June 2025

## Overview

This document explores integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Anode notebooks to provide extensible AI tooling capabilities. However, given our function calling architecture, we question whether full MCP protocol support is necessary versus simply enabling users to write Python functions.

## Background

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a specification for connecting AI assistants to external tools and data sources. It provides a standardized way for AI models to interact with various services, databases, and APIs.

## Core Question: Do We Need MCP?

### Option A: Full MCP Protocol Support
Implement complete MCP client/server architecture within the kernel.

### Option B: Function-First Approach  
Enable users to write Python functions that achieve the same goals as MCP providers.

## Function-First Analysis

### What MCP Provides vs Python Functions

| MCP Capability | Python Function Equivalent |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| File system access | `os`, `pathlib` modules |
| Database queries | `sqlite3`, `psycopg2`, etc. |
| API calls | `requests`, `httpx` |
| Git operations | `gitpython` |
| Calendar access | `caldav`, Google APIs |
| Slack integration | `slack_sdk` |

### Example: Database Access

**MCP Approach:**
MCP providers define standardized tool schemas for database access with formal input/output specifications.

**Python Function Approach:**
Users write native Python functions using existing libraries (psycopg2, sqlite3, etc.) and register them for AI access. Implementation details for registration mechanism to be determined.

## Proposed Hybrid Approach

### Phase 1: Function-First Foundation
Focus on making Python functions powerful and discoverable through:
- Rich metadata and categorization
- Parameter validation and examples
- Documentation and type hints
- Discovery mechanisms for installed packages

Specific registration API and metadata format to be designed during implementation.

### Phase 2: MCP Compatibility Layer (Future)
If MCP adoption grows, add a compatibility layer that can:
- Discover and import MCP provider definitions
- Convert MCP tools to Python function equivalents
- Handle MCP client/server communication
- Provide unified interface between native functions and MCP tools

Implementation approach to be determined based on ecosystem needs.

## Implementation Strategy

### Function Discovery Enhancement

Enhanced function discovery will support:
- Built-in notebook functions
- User-defined functions in current session
- Package-level functions from installed libraries
- Future MCP provider integration

Discovery mechanisms will scan for:
- Decorated functions in user code
- Package-exposed AI functions via convention
- Metadata and documentation for each function

Implementation details for scanning and registration to be determined.

### Package-Level Function Registration

Package-level function registration will follow a standard convention for exposing AI-callable functions, allowing the kernel to discover and register functions from installed packages automatically.

Specific convention and metadata format to be designed during implementation.

## MCP Integration Architecture (Future)

### If We Eventually Support MCP

MCP provider management will handle:
- Provider lifecycle (connect, disconnect, health checks)
- Tool discovery and registration
- Conversion between MCP tool schemas and Python function signatures
- Error handling and fallback strategies

Implementation architecture to be determined if MCP integration is needed.

### MCP Provider Discovery

MCP provider configuration will allow users to specify:
- Provider connection details and transport methods
- Environment variables and authentication
- Tool filtering and customization options
- Automatic registration preferences

Configuration format and registration process to be designed if MCP support is implemented.

## Open Questions

### Function-First Approach
- **Q**: How to handle authentication for external services in functions?
- **Q**: Should we provide utility classes for common integrations (DB, APIs)?
- **Q**: How to manage dependencies for user functions?

### MCP Integration (Future)
- **Q**: Do we need to support the full MCP protocol or just tool calling?
- **Q**: How to handle MCP provider lifecycle and failures?
- **Q**: Should MCP providers run in the same process as the kernel?
- **Q**: How to sandbox MCP providers for security?

### Hybrid Model
- **Q**: Can we transparently convert between MCP tools and Python functions?
- **Q**: Should users see the difference between MCP tools and Python functions?
- **Q**: How to handle version compatibility between MCP protocol versions?

## Decision Framework

### Start with Functions If:
- âœ… Most user needs can be met with Python packages
- âœ… Function registration is simpler to implement and debug
- âœ… Users prefer writing Python over configuring external tools
- âœ… We want to minimize external dependencies

### Add MCP Support If:
- ðŸ“‹ Many high-quality MCP providers emerge in the ecosystem
- ðŸ“‹ Users specifically request MCP compatibility
- ðŸ“‹ Complex tool configurations become common
- ðŸ“‹ We need to integrate with non-Python services

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Enhanced Function Registry (1 month)
- [ ] Package-level function discovery
- [ ] Rich function metadata and examples
- [ ] Function categorization and search
- [ ] Authentication helpers for common services

### Phase 2: MCP Evaluation (TBD)
- [ ] Survey MCP ecosystem maturity
- [ ] User research on MCP vs function preferences  
- [ ] Prototype MCP integration if needed
- [ ] Performance comparison between approaches

### Phase 3: MCP Integration (If Needed)
- [ ] MCP client implementation
- [ ] Provider management and lifecycle
- [ ] Security sandboxing for providers
- [ ] Transparent function/MCP tool conversion

## Recommendation

**Start with the function-first approach.** It's simpler, leverages Python's rich ecosystem, and provides immediate value. We can always add MCP compatibility later if the ecosystem demands it.

The core question is: "Can users accomplish their goals by writing Python functions?" For most notebook use cases, the answer is likely yes.

## Success Metrics

- **Function Ecosystem**: Number of packages exposing AI-callable functions
- **User Adoption**: Percentage of users creating custom functions
- **External Integration**: Successfully connect to databases, APIs, services via functions
- **MCP Demand**: User requests for specific MCP providers

**Next Steps**: Focus on enhancing Python function capabilities before considering full MCP protocol support.

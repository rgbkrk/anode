# Anode Development Roadmap

**Vision**: A real-time collaborative notebook system enabling seamless AI ↔ Python ↔ User interactions through local-first architecture.

**Current Status**: Core prototype with collaborative editing and basic Python execution working. Rich outputs and AI integration in active development.

## Foundation Complete ✅

### Core Architecture
- **LiveStore event-sourcing** - Real-time collaborative state management
- **Direct TypeScript schema** - No build complexity, full type safety
- **Reactive execution queue** - Kernel work detection without polling
- **Cell management** - Create, edit, move, delete with proper state sync
- **Basic Python execution** - Code cells run via Pyodide (manual kernel startup)

### What Users Can Do Today
- Create and edit notebooks collaboratively in real-time
- Execute Python code with text output and error handling
- Navigate cells with keyboard shortcuts
- Work offline and sync when connected

## Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 Weeks)

### 1. Integration Testing & Verification
**Goal**: Prove the system works as claimed

- [ ] **Real Pyodide integration tests** - Verify Python execution end-to-end
- [ ] **Rich output testing** - Matplotlib, pandas, IPython.display verification
- [ ] **Performance validation** - Measure actual execution speeds vs claims
- [ ] **Error scenario testing** - Kernel failures, network issues, edge cases

### 2. Automated Kernel Management
**Goal**: Remove manual `NOTEBOOK_ID=xyz pnpm dev:kernel` friction

- [ ] **Auto-spawning kernels** - One-click notebook startup
- [ ] **Kernel health monitoring** - Detect failures and restart
- [ ] **Better status UI** - Clear feedback on kernel state
- [ ] **Error recovery** - Graceful handling of kernel disconnections

### 3. Rich Output System Completion
**Goal**: Deliver on Jupyter-quality visualizations

- [ ] **Matplotlib SVG rendering** - Verify plots display correctly

### User Experience Polish
- [ ] **Keyboard navigation improvements** - Jupyter-like arrow key behavior
- [ ] **Better error messages** - Clear feedback for all failure modes
- [ ] **Execution indicators** - Visual feedback during code execution
- [ ] **Cell output management** - Clear outputs, output collapsing

## Medium-term Vision (3-6 Months)

### Real AI Integration
**Note**: Currently in development on separate branch

- [ ] **OpenAI/Anthropic APIs** - Replace mock responses with real AI

- [ ] **Context awareness** - AI understands notebook state
- [ ] **Code generation** - AI suggests and writes code based on data
- [ ] **Smart completions** - AI-powered code and SQL suggestions

### Advanced Collaboration
- [ ] **User presence** - See who's actively editing
- [ ] **Collaborative cursors** - Real-time editing indicators  
- [ ] **Comment system** - Discuss code and results inline
- [ ] **Version control** - Leverage event-sourcing for notebook history

### Interactive Widgets
- [ ] **IPython widgets support** - Interactive UI components
- [ ] **Real-time streaming outputs** - Progress bars, live updates
- [ ] **Collaborative widgets** - Shared interactive components
- [ ] **Custom widget framework** - Build domain-specific tools

## Long-term Aspirations (6+ Months)

### Production Readiness
- [ ] **Authentication system** - Google OAuth, user management
- [ ] **Multi-tenant deployment** - Isolated environments per organization
- [ ] **Performance optimization** - Handle large notebooks and datasets
- [ ] **Monitoring and analytics** - Usage tracking and performance metrics

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **Jupyter compatibility** - Import/export .ipynb files seamlessly

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- Notebook startup time: < 5 seconds (including kernel)
- Python execution latency: < 1 second for simple operations
- Collaboration sync delay: < 100ms
- Rich output rendering: < 2 seconds for complex plots

### Developer Experience  
- Setup time for new contributors: < 10 minutes
- Test suite execution: < 30 seconds
- Hot reload time: < 1 second

## Architecture Principles

### Preserve Core Strengths
- **Event-sourcing foundation** - Never lose user work, perfect audit trails
- **Local-first operation** - Work offline, sync when connected
- **Real-time collaboration** - Multiple users, zero conflicts
- **Type safety** - End-to-end TypeScript with Effect

### Guide Development Decisions
- **User workflow first** - Optimize for data science and literate computing
- **Zero-latency interactions** - Immediate feedback for all operations
- **Minimal friction** - Remove setup complexity and manual steps
- **Progressive enhancement** - Core functionality works, advanced features optional
